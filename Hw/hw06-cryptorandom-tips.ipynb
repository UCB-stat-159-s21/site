    "First, you need to make a change to `conf.py` so that the build can be seen through a JupyterHub installation. This change can probably go into cryptorandom proper in the end, but for now we suggest you make it directly into the team repo in a single commit, that all team members then pull from, so you all have it in one place. You need to add three lines below - the comment is there in the file already, around line 108, and we leave it here for ease of reference. You neeed to add the code starting with `import os`:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to make sure these changes apply everywhere, in the `doc/` directory run `make clean` once after the above, and then continue with the below. In what follows you may want to keep at least _two_ terminals open, one where you keep running the HTML Sphinx build, and one to run the server to check your builds (some might keep a third open in the top-level directory for git work, commits, pushes, etc). Take advantage of JupyterLab's ability to lay them out in whatever way you find most visually convenient!\n",

    "Once you make these changes you should commit and push them to the team repo, and all members need to ensure they pull from that correctly and they all have the same `conf.py`."
