    "These notes should help you work through some of the issues we discussed in lecture today, regarding how to render the sphinx documentation for cryptorandom in the hub, and how to then view your own build of these docs through the hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically we need to solve the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We need to ensure that pytest, Sphinx and other tools find and use our in-development version of `cryptorandom` instead of the system-wide one, so our new work is reflected in the tests and documentation we create.\n",
    "1. We need to be able to build the documentation on JupyterHub and view the resulting docs online easily, through the Hub.\n",

    "## Install `cryptorandom` locally in development mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The first issue we must solve is for Sphinx to find the version of `cryptorandom` that you are working on, rather than the installed one. This manifests itself immediately as the `AttributeError` you see regarding a missing `__version__` attribute when trying to build the docs, but even if you fix that with a quick hack as I did in lecture, you'll still have a problem. The issue is that the docs will import the _system-wide installed_ version of `cryptorandom`, and not your local development copy. So any new docstrings or function signatures you edit will not be correctly reflected in the resulting docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is to install your working copy as a _development version_, also known as an _\"editable install\"_ (hence the `-e` command line argument). We now explain how to do this, and you can find more details in the [pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs).\n",

    "## Set up the sphinx build for JupyterHub-hosted viewing\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you need to make a change to `conf.py` so that the build can be seen through a JupyterHub installation. This change can probably go into cryptorandom proper in the end, but for now we suggest you make it directly into the team repo in a single commit, that all team members then pull from, so you all have it in one place. You need to add three lines below - the comment is there in the file already, around line 108, and we leave it here for ease of reference. You neeed to add the code starting with `import os`:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to make sure these changes apply everywhere, in the `doc/` directory run `make clean` once after the above, and then continue with the below. In what follows you may want to keep at least _two_ terminals open, one where you keep running the HTML Sphinx build, and one to run the server to check your builds (some might keep a third open in the top-level directory for git work, commits, pushes, etc). Take advantage of JupyterLab's ability to lay them out in whatever way you find most visually convenient!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you make these changes you should commit and push them to the team repo, and all members need to ensure they pull from that correctly and they all have the same `conf.py`."
