    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:** Statistics 133, 134, 135, willingness to work with a team of\n",
    "peers, dedication. Students are expected to be comfortable with LaTeX, Markdown,\n",

    "These are some basic expectations of students with regards to academic integrity:\n",
    "Any work submitted should be your own individual thoughts, and should not have been submitted\n",
    "for credit in another course unless you have prior written permission to re-use it in this \n",
    "course from this instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "All assignments must use \"proper attribution,\" meaning that you have identified the original\n",

    "If you are unclear about expectations, ask your instructor.\n",
