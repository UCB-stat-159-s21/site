    "+ choose the desired coverage probability $1-\\alpha$ and the sample size $n$\n",

    "+ compute the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ and sample standard deviation $s$\n",
    "+ find $\\hat{SE} = f \\times s/\\sqrt{n}$, the estimated standard error of the sample mean, where $f=1$ for sampling with replacement, and $f = \\sqrt{\\frac{N-n}{N-1}}$ for sampling without replacement ($N$ is the\n",
    "population size)\n",
    "+ find $t$, the appropriate critical value of Student's t distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom\n",
    "+ the approximate 2-sided confidence interval is $[\\bar{X} - t \\hat{SE}, \\bar{X} + t \\hat{SE}]$.\n",
