    "# Confidence intervals based on the normal approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first things most statisticians would consider is to use confidence based on the normal approximation, especially if it were possible to draw a moderately large sample (e.g., 100 or more units).\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure would be:\n",
    "+ choose the desired coverage probability $1-\\alpha$ and the sample size $n$\n",
    "+ draw a simple random sample or a random sample with replacement of size $n$ from the population\n",
    "+ compute the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ and sample standard deviation $s$\n",
    "+ find $\\hat{SE} = f \\times s/\\sqrt{n}$, the estimated standard error of the sample mean, where $f=1$ for sampling with replacement, and $f = \\sqrt{\\frac{N-n}{N-1}}$ for sampling without replacement ($N$ is the\n",
    "population size)\n",
    "+ find $t$, the appropriate critical value of Student's t distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom\n",
    "+ the approximate 2-sided confidence interval is $[\\bar{X} - t \\hat{SE}, \\bar{X} + t \\hat{SE}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _Formally_, this gives an approximate confidence interval, but there's no guarantee that the actual coverage probability is close to the nominal coverage probability\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Normal approximation is common, but can be grossly inaccurate, especially with:\n",
    "  - small sample sizes\n",
    "  - skewed populations\n",
    "  \n",
    "In auditing situations, typical for the distributions to be very skewed: point mass at zero, mixed with something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Examine scenarios by simulation.\n",
    "+ First scenario is a population of zeros and ones, in various proportions\n",
    "+ Second scenario is \"nonstandard\" mixture of pointmass at 0 and a Uniform\n",
    "\n",
    "We are estimating the coverage by simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simulations:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ it's important to know which pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) you are using (Python uses the Mersenne Twister by default)\n",
    "+ it's important to assess whether that PRNG is adequate  (the Mersenne twister is pretty good for statistical simulations, but not good enough for cryptographic applications)\n",
    "+ it's important to remember that your estimates will have sampling error\n",
    "+ if the result matters, you should quantify the sampling error, for instance, by a confidence interval for the estimated result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use 1000 or 10,000 iterations in the estimates. For estimating probabilities, the standard error of the result is no larger than $1/(2\\sqrt{n})$: 1.58% for $n=1000$ and 0.5% for $n=10,000$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For estimating things like expected length, guarantees of accuracy are harder, but the kinds of techniques we will see over this short course can be applied to _that_ problem too."
