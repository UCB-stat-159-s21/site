    "## Types of Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Many different kinds of things are called \"parameters.\" Here are several categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Population parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Any property of a population may be called a _parameter_.\n",
    "Examples include the population mean, percentiles, number of modes, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the population has more than one \"value\" per item, e.g., if the population is a group of people each of whom has a height and a weight, then the population correlation between height and weight is a parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, consider a group of individuals and the values of some quantity (the \"response\") for each of those individuals without and with some intervention (notionally, a \"treatment\").\n",
    "The difference between the average response without the intervention and the average response with the intervention is a parameter (the _average treatment effect_).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are sampling at random from a population, the probability distribution of the sample\n",
    "depends on the values in the population, and thus, in general, on the \n",
    "values of population parameters.\n",
    "(It will also depend on the sampling design.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functional parameters of probability distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $X \\sim P$, where $P$ is a probability distribution on some space $\\mathcal{X}$ of possible outcomes.\n",
    "We assume that $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, some known set of possible distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _functional parameter_ $\\theta(P)$ is a function of $P$.\n",
    "For instance the (population) mean is a functional parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\theta(P) = \\mathbb{E}X \\equiv \\int_\\mathcal{X} x dP(x).\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "So are other moments of the probability distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\theta(P) = \\mathbb{E}X^n \\equiv \\int_\\mathcal{X} x^n dP(x), \\;\\; n=1, 2, \\ldots .\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Other properties of $P$, such as percentiles of a univariate\n",
    "distribution, are also functional parameters.\n",
    "For instance, if $X$ is a real-valued random variable,\n",
    "then the $\\alpha$ percentile of $P$,\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\theta(P) = P_\\alpha \\equiv \\inf \\left \\{x: \\int_{-\\infty}^x dP(x) \\ge \\alpha \\right \\},\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "is a functional parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For multivariate distributions, correlations among the components of $X$\n",
    "are functional parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, there can be distinct distributions $P$ and $Q$ such that \n",
    "$P \\ne Q$ but $\\theta(P) = \\theta(Q)$. \n",
    "For instance there are infinitely many normal distributions with the\n",
    "same mean (but different variances).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters as indices of sets of distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Another use of the term \"parameter\" is as an abstract\n",
    "index that points to a particular distribution in\n",
    "a family of distributions.\n",
    "For instance, we might have a multiset of distributions\n",
    "$\\mathcal{P} = \\{P_\\eta\\}_{\\eta \\in \\Theta}$.\n",
    "In that case, $\\eta$ is an index parameter.\n",
    "For index parameters, if for all parameters $\\eta$, $\\nu \\in \\Theta$ such that\n",
    "$\\eta \\ne \\nu$, $P_\\eta \\ne P_\\nu$, the parameter is said to be _identifiable_.\n",
    "That is, $X$ contains enough information to\n",
    "identify the value of the parameter with arbitrarily high accuracy, given enough\n",
    "observations.\n",
    "Otherwise, the parameter is _non-identifiable_ or _unidentifiable_: the data\n",
    "do not contain enough information to distinguish among different values\n",
    "of the parameter, no matter how many observations are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Special case: location-scale families\n",
    "\n",
    "Many indexed families of distributions are related through the\n",
    "value of their parameter in a particular way. \n",
    "For instance, suppose that the outcome space $\\mathcal{X}$ is a real vector space,\n",
    "so it makes sense to add elements of $\\mathcal{X}$ and to multiply them by scalars.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X \\sim P$, then for any $\\theta \\in \\mathcal{X}$ and $a \\in \\Re \\backslash \\{0\\}$,\n",
    "we could define $P_{\\theta,a}$ to be the distribution of $aX+\\theta$.\n",
    "Then $\\{P_{\\theta, a} \\}_{\\theta \\in \\mathcal{X}, a \\in \\Re \\backslash \\{0\\}}$ is a \n",
    "_location-scale family_\n",
    "with parameter $(\\theta, a)$\n",
    "As $\\theta$ varies, the probability distribution \"shifts\" its location.\n",
    "As $a$ varies, the probability distribution $P$ is \"stretched\" or re-scaled.\n",
    "The family of univariate normal distributions is a location-scale family over the two-dimensional parameter $\\theta = (\\mu, \\sigma)$ with $\\mu \\in \\Re$, $\\sigma \\in \\Re \\backslash 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notation for index parameters\n",
    "To keep the notation for index parameters\n",
    "parallel with the notation for functional parameters, we will define $\\theta(P) \\equiv \n",
    "\\{ \\eta: P = P_\\eta\\}$.\n",
    "If $\\theta$ is identifiable, $\\theta(P)$ is a singleton set; otherwise,\n",
    "it may contain more than one value. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Parametric families of distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "A _parametric family of distributions_ is an indexed collection of probability distributions\n",
    "that depends on the index parameter (which might be multidimensional) in a \n",
    "fixed functional way.\n",
    "(We can think of things like the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution as either a multidimensional parameter or as a collection of parameters.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Most distributions that have names are parametric families, e.g., Bernoulli (the parameter $p$), Binomial (the two-dimensional parameter $(n, p)$), Geometric ($p$), Hypergeometric (the three-dimensional parameter $(N, G, n)$), Negative Binomial $(p, k)$, Normal $(\\mu, \\sigma)$, Student's $T$ $(\\mu, \\sigma, \\nu)$, continuous uniform (the endpoints of the interval of support, the two-dimensional parameter $(a, b)$), and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nuisance parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "When the probability distribution of the data depends on a multi-dimensional parameter\n",
    "but only some components of that parameter are of interest, the other components are called _nuisance parameters_. \n",
    "For instance, in estimating the mean of a normal distribution, the\n",
    "variance of the distribution is a nuisance parameter: we don't care what it is,\n",
    "but it affects the probability distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, in estimating a population mean from a stratified sample, the means\n",
    "within the different strata are nuisance parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "For most of the theory in this chapter, $\\theta$ will be an abstract parameter:\n",
    "the development applies to functional parameters, index parameters, parameters of\n",
    "parametric families, etc."
