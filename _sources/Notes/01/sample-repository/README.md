# Sample GitHub repository

This repository is set up for testing and experimentation. Feel free to clone and push your changes as part of our ICESat-2 GitHub tutorial lesson.

## Instructions

Clone this repository to your local directory. Start by copying the URL for this Git repository to your clipboard:

![copy git URL to clipboard](img/clone-copy-clipboard.png)

Next, clone this repository to your local directory. Type "git clone" and then paste in the URL:

 ```git clone https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/sample-repository.git```

Now, make some changes! In order for us all to avoid merge conflicts, let's create a new folder in the "participants" folder. Give the folder a unique name, for example your first name and last name. Inside that folder, create some arbitrary text file.
