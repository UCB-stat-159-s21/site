    "The basic reproductive number $R_0 = \\beta/\\gamma$ is the number of people each infected person infects before recovering or dying. Note that this interpretation depends on the assumption that, initially, essentially the entire population is susceptible (the proportion who are infected or recovered is small compared to $N$).\n",
